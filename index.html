                <div id="faq1" class="faq-content">A:The cost of repairing these appliances can vary based on the issue and the appliance's brand and model. On average, oven repairs range from $145 to $390, with a typical cost around $270. Stove or cooktop repairs generally fall between $130 and $415, averaging approximately $250 to $270.

                <div id="faq2" class="faq-content">A:Deciding between repairing or replacing your oven depends on several factors, including the appliance's age, the severity of the issue, and repair costs. If your oven is over 10-15 years old and requires frequent or costly repairs, it might be more economical to replace it. However, for newer ovens with minor issues, repairs are often the more cost-effective choice. Consulting with a professional technician can provide clarity on the best course of action. **</div>
